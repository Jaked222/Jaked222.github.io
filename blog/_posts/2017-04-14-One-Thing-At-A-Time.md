# Making the most out of our precious time

Productivity is something I've been thinking about a lot lately. What is it that makes me feel extremely focused some days, and lazy on others? Part of the difficulty in answering this question must come from the innumerable variables that surround the physiology of all life. To try and pin-point the cause of my cyclical energy levels and mental clarity is no simple task. One can easily concoct lists, weave circular questions and feel streams of guilt trying to figure out why they're having a bad day, while entirely forgetting that they just didn't get much sleep last night. 

One of the most useful tools I've learned to become more productive is simply consistency. There's a lot of goals we'd like to reach or people we'd like to become within the next few years, but we often put the actual climbing off for another time. Without taking action, nothing will happen. Thinking about a goal and chasing it is far different. This is why setting the intention to do something every day, regardless of if you're tired or feeling great, has been an amazing strategy for me. 

A lot of my ideas on productivity come from [Tim Ferris's Podcast](http://tim.blog/podcast/), so I figured I'd mention it.

# Ideas, and how I make them work for me...

Once I've accepted that I function in cycles of ups and downs, I free myself to actually pursue my goals. Often I will be too hard on myself, and after a bad meditation or piano practice session, I'll give up and feel like a failure. In that way, I end up not practicing for a while, and truly head towards failure. When I accept that I will have bad days, I leave myself open for the good days to happen. Who will be the better piano player: A person who plays 15 days in a row, 10 of those being "bad" days and 5 being "good" days; or a person who never plays at all? Besides, those bad days probably aren't as bad as I often like to think. Everything is just relative. A bad day compared to a great day seems bad, but it's much better than not heading towards my goal at all. Even if you miss a day or let a goal down in some way, it is extremely important to continue on the next day. Persistence leads to true progress.

If you want to start going running, wear your running shoes every day. This seemingly ridiculous tip applies to everything and is more helpful than it seems. Setting a simple goal like this is taking the first step, which is always the hardest. If you set the goal to just meditate 2 minutes a day, chances are you'll meditate more than that. Some days you won't, but thats okay too. It's all part of reconditioning yourself to spend time on different tasks and not waste time, even if it doesn't always go well.
