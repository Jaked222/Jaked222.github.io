# Laziness and Me

Yesterday, I was feeling under the weather. My "first life" of programming from 9-5 went well, although I noticed a tiredness that wouldn't be easily shaken off. I went home and tried to begin my usual after-work activities (otherwise known as life #2), but found myself spinning in weariness, indecision and laziness. I hopped around from one thing to the next, mind chattering and continually making excuses as to why I felt so despondent. I did enjoy a brief repose when reading a few interesting chapters of Dune, but after a distraction I couldn't get back into it again. Around 8PM I decided to have a drink, watch a movie and pass out afterwards.

Today, I noticed that the cycle was starting again. Low energy at work had me believing a sickness was coming on. I felt dizzy, nauseous and somehow tired and anxious at the same time. I was on my way home, in the strangely dreamy in-between world of Life #1 and #2, when I decided that I wouldn't let sickness defeat me. That I would fight it in the same way it was fighting me, and continue on to do the things I enjoy, regardless of how much I felt drained. This is when I decided to meditate.

## Turning it around

I usually meditate daily, but had been spending a lot of time over at Sadie's place this weekend and didn't have any sitdowns. I forget how amazing meditating makes me feel, but today I will speak it. Meditation is a pallette cleanser, it frees the mind and invigorates the body. The attention is usually pulled around without rest, creating a sense of being overwhelmed. Today, I have been healed by meditation. Just a short session of sitting and feeling the inner/outer world come together was enough to completely cleanse my state of mind. Either my lack of meditation was making me sick, or my sickness was cured by meditation. Regardless this day won't be forgotten (thanks to this blog post). 

I felt a state of being. I felt a state of peace. I know it was real. Much more real than any symbols in the mind or on a page.
