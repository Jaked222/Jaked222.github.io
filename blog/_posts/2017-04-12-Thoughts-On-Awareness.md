title: Thoughts (viewed) On Awareness...

Before my daily meditation practice, there are usually a few stages of preparation. The first is simply deciding that I will meditate. I'll begin to feel my body and my state of mind as I get myself situated. This may involve preparing some tea, getting a singing bowl, going outside or getting into my posture, etc. It is said that one should never jump straight into meditation, so even the moments leading up to meditation are absolutely part of the game. Eventually, the goal is to extend this "preparation" period to the point that it meets back around with yesterday's "ending" period.... But that's a story for another day.

After finding a comfortable posture, I was sitting outside and enjoying beautiful weather. Sun shining on my face was a refreshing warmth, a shared experience with the trees beginning to bloom and birds chirping their unique tunes. This was extremely important to my coming meditation, because it began the process of bringing my awareness away from the continual flow of thoughts, and into the simpler sensations of life. Thankfully, I've found that bringing the awareness away from the monkey mind also tends to slow the rate of thoughts down. Don't let this idea be a trap, though. 

To reject the mind in its present state seems to always lead to frustration. Allowing the mind to speak freely while anchoring myself to the breath and sensations has been the only successful strategy for me. When I notice I've been paying attention to something other than my anchors (breath, sensations), I don't have to worry about what sorts of pestering thoughts, emotions, or feelings have been grabbing my attention. All I have to do is go back to an anchor, and I *know* that I will soon have my desired physiological outcome.

# Questions...


If I can figure out how to put comments below here, I have a few questions for anyone who might be reading. Can it be helpful to allow oneself to set multiple anchors? For example, the breath as a main, and secondary the sound of birds and feeling of the sun on your skin? Perhaps this way, the mind can slow down to the state that one pointed awareness of breath could be possible. It's been made very clear to me that going from heavy mental activity to one-pointed awareness of breath is not happening, and some sort of progression is necessary, at least while still learning. 

It isn't really necessary to decide on certain things as anchors, but to be open to the idea that the awareness can move around at it's leisure, enjoying and basking in life as it is while being very conscious of the activity of the thoughts and emotions. This brings me to another question I've been working with, which is the true meaning of one-pointed awareness, and whether or not we can expand our awareness to feel multiple things at once. If you can be aware of your finger, you're actually aware of many thousands of cells at once. How far can we stretch this? Where is the boundary?
