* **Unknown creators/Misc:**
  * My Lonely Road
  * Surrender
  * Roses - Outkast
  * [Heart n Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54v442rETnI)
  * Warmness on the soul - Avenged Sevenfold : i -> VI -> III -> VII
  * Hallelujah piano cover
  * Canon in D or C
  * Imagining - Brian Crain: i -> III -> VI -> IV 
  * Mad World - Gary Jules: i -> III -> VI -> IV 
  * Souvenir's Penthouse - Leon Noel
  * Creep - Radiohead: I -> iii -> IV -> iv
  * pan's labrynth theme: i -> iv -> iib5 -> V
  * LOTR theme song: I -> V -> vi -> IV
  * Eminem - Stan: i -> VI (or try IV) -> VII -> walk down III-> VII -> i
  * Eminem - Mockingbird: i -> VI -> VII -> i
  * minor plagal cadence: I -> IV -> iv -> I (as seen in Creep and In My Life)
  * In my Life beatles: I -> V -> vi -> V7/IV(note below) -> IV -> iv -> I
  * Sweet child o mine: C major -> B flat major -> F major, then G major -> B flat major -> F major, then D minor -> Bflat major -> A major -> g major back to d minor. Don't know how to describe these in roman numeral notation. What key is this in?
  * *Note on the V7/IV chord: This is playing the dominant seventh chord OF the fourth scale interval that you're playing. So this chord     if played in the key of A Major would be A7 (A dominant seventh) because A7 is the dominant seventh of D. This follows up nicely to     the plagal cadence which in this case would be D (IV) -> d (iv) -> A(I). Also try playing notes from the root minor scale when we're     playing the vi chord.*
  * Have yourself a merry xmas (interesting modulation): C -> a -> d7 -> G -> x2 -> C -> a -> bdim7(b d f a) -> E -> a (doing 2 5 1 to a minor)
  * Coco - Remember me - does this ^ also. Do C -> f -> C -> bdim7 -> E -> a
  * *Note: this modulation can similarly be done with jumping up to the tritone and doing 2-5-1... for example C -> fdim7(f# a c e) -> B     -> e)*
  * Weird chromatic progression: c minor, d major, c# major, c major. Walk down chromatically melodic every chord starting on g
