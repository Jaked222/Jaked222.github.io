## Some info I wrote:

This is a great reference. Remember that a chord (major or minor) is just the first - also called the root - plus the third plus the fifth of the scale. throw on the root at the end for funzies too. You can use this reference for the key signatures, notes and proper fingerings (actually follow these, its important to get exposed to as many different fingering techniques as possible early on, even if it feels weird to you. You can always change it later, thats fine, but forcing yourself to conform to weird fingerings is part of it.) 

as for practicing sight reading, heres something for free:

and heres something from amazon:

https://www.amazon.com/More-Easy-Classics-Moderns-Millions/dp/082564027X

As for the first link, I used to use this. Its like a compendium of pieces with all the possible weird things that can happen on sheet music. Its not exactly practical or very musical, but you'll learn a lot and Its a good starting spot. in the beginning, it progresses slowly, so the first 30 pieces or so will be super easy, way easier than any easy piece in the next link.  The second link is just a book of lots of easy pieces by all sorts of composers. I have the other version of this book and use it for sight reading practice now.

Whichever you want to go with, don't spend too much time on one piece, don't look back. For sight reading, you don't want to actually try to learn or memorize the piece, cus that takes away from the sight reading. Just play straight through, as slowly as you need to (VERY SLOWLY). You can also spend time just reading the notes while you're away from the piano, this will help.

Finally, I definitely would recommend learning some piece that is slightly harder, to push your mechanical skills more than the sight reading practice will (although i bet theres some pieces in the Easy Classics To Moderns that you could find which would be perfect). 

Heres another good one for you to spend some time on (not sight reading this yet ofcourse)

The goal is to get your sheet reading ability up to the point that you can read and recognize what you're SUPPOSED to play faster than you can actually play it. The best way to do this is just read a lot of music. Do sight reading, and find some piece of slightly higher difficulty that you can work on and study.
