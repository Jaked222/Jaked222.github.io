This site is not meant to serve as a resume for programming, because I don't want my skills judged based on the appearance or construction of it. The pages are just for me and whomever may stumble upon it, and I very much wanted something simple for that purpose. 

I currently am working for Applied Visions Inc, in Northport NY. This is my first job and I am working on numerous projects using mainly these technologies: C#/.NET, Java, Javascript/Node.js, SQL, Microsoft Azure. There's tons of other things I've gotten my hands into though. If you're curious, please [email me](mailto:jakecduncan@gmail.com).
