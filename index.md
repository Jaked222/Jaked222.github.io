### Brief Bio

I'm Jake. I am 23 years old and as I mentioned, I have a few separate lives. 

**Life #1:** 
My relationship life.  I love to love my family and friends. If you're reading this, you're likely to be one of them. This is arguably my most important life. Nonetheless all parts of the body are required to function, and all of my lives are required for my happiness.

**Life #2:**
My professional life. I work as a Software Developer for Applied Visions, Inc. in Northport NY. I work on various software projects using lots of different tech. 

**Life #3:**
My internal life. When my other two lives have taken time off, I kick into gear with music, literature of many different types,meditation, journaling/active thinking, exercise, among other enjoyable things. 




I keep myself busy. I find that I'm happier this way. Humans like to strive for things. They're not satisfied at the summit nor the valley. So, I keep climbing. Of course, a few scenic detours are encouraged along the way.

As of now, I'm making this website for the fun of it. Refining another tool to be added to my box persay. I may end up putting some things here such as links to my musical creations, info about my programming persuits, or inspiring writing i've come across.
